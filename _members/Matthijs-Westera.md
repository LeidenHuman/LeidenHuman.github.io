I am Assistant Professor in Humanities and AI at LUCL in Leiden (SAILS). I'm working on:

- The relation between distributional/neural semantics, formal semantics and experimental pragmatics (these, two papers with Gemma Boleda).
- Extracting information from state-of-the-art coreference models as a proxy for referent anticipation in discourse.
- The TED-Q dataset of TED-talks and the questions they evoke (paper with Laia Mayol and Hannah Rohde), with ongoing modelling work based on my earlier attempt and this neat little paper (not by me).
- Online experiments and annotation tasks (e.g., question comparison, picture-name evaluation, question elicitation, category relatedness).
Previously I worked on closed-world reasoning (exhaustivity/scalar inference), the pragmatics of joint attention, and the meaning of intonation.
