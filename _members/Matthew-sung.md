My main research interest is on general dialectology, the study of geographical variation of language. I am interested in questions like "do dialect boundaries exists?" and "how did a specific linguistic feature spread from one place to another?". I am also interested in exploring the dialect variation of tones. How do dialects differ on the tonal level? Do we find a dialect continuum with tones? These are all questions that I would like to explore further.

I will specifically look at Yue (粵語) as a case study in my PhD project and on top of addressing the dialectological issues above, I will revisit the topic of dialect classification for Yue.

## Fields of interest
- General Dialectology
- Segmental and Tonal Variation
- Dialect Classification
- Historical Reconstruction
- Yue (粵語) dialectology
