Jiehai Liu is a guest researcher at the Leiden University Center for Linguistics hosted by Prof. Dr. Sjef Barbiers. He holds a Ph.D. in linguistics from Nanjing University, China. His research interests include syntax, cognitive grammar, construction grammar, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Currently, he is studying mirativity in Chinese constructions at Leiden University. Two parts of his research are involved. The first is to use cognitive construction grammar to examine the mechanism of mirativity production and comprehension. In addition, the study of miratives in Chinese and other languages can be supported using natural language processing and machine learning technologies.
