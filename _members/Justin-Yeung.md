I am a current BSc Communication Science student at the University of Amsterdam and upcoming MSc Social Data Science Student at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. My research interests span across political communication, digital humanities and computational social sciences. My research mainly focuses on the relations between algorithms, journalism and citizens. 

Currently, Justin is interested in applying computational methods to study and compare the information network of diasporic communities, particularly in understanding the information diffusion among distinct communities and how mis/disinformation are spread. His goals are to create constructive communicative tools (e.g., diasporic information mapping)for diasporic communities to fight against the power structure imposed by the digital platforms and algorithms. 

## Fields of interest
- Network theory and network analysis
- Political communication
- Science and Technology Studies (STS)
- Migration and media studies
