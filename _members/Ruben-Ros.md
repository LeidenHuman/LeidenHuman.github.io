My research focusses on the history of twentieth-century Dutch political thought and culture. In my dissertation project I study technocratic reasoning in parliamentary debate. Using computational methods, I aim to find and explain the employment of expertise in political language.

Ruben Ros completed the Research Master's in History at Utrecht University with distinction in 2019. He wrote his thesis on the conceptual history of "the foreign" in nineteenth-century Dutch periodicals. During and after the MA, Ruben specialized in computational text analysis and conceptual history. After internships at the Helsinki Computational History Group and the KNAW DH Lab and a research project on visual cultural memory, he started his dissertation project in 2020.
