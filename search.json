    "section": "",
    "text": "Traditional dialectology or dialect geography is the study of geographical variation of language. Originated in Europe and pioneered in Germany and France, this field has predominantly been focusing on sounds, more specifically, on segments. Similarly, quantitative approaches to language variation concerned with the phonetic level are in most cases focusing on segments as well. However, more than half of the world’s languages include lexical tones (Yip, 2002). Despite this, tones are still underexplored in quantitative language comparison, partly due to the low accessibility of the suitable data. This paper aims to introduce a newly digitised dataset which comes from the Yue- and Pinghua-speaking areas in Southern China, with over 100 dialects. This dataset consists of two parts: tones and segments. In this paper, we illustrate how we can computationaly model tones in order to explore linguistic variation. We have applied a tone distance metric on our data, and we have found that 1) dialects also form a continuum on the tonal level and 2) other than tonemic (inventory) and tonetic differences, dialects can also differ in the lexical distribution of tones. The availability of this dataset will hopefully enable further exploration of the role of tones in quantitative typology and NLP research.\n\n\n\nLocalities and their respective sources"

Do we find similar patterns in dialectal variation of Yue like we do in Europe? I will also revisit the classification of Yue dialects, including the internal classification within Yue, and the Yue-Pinghua dichotomy. Are Yue and Pinghua two separate Sinitic branches?

    "text": "Sails Lunch Time Seminar: The Role of AI in the Humanities\nEver since the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the vast majority of research at the intersection of the Humanities and AI was dedicated to the ethical side of AI and how AI impacts our cultures and societies. While philosophy and critical thinking of AI remain indispensable research areas in the Humanities, lately there has been a surge of research that uses AI to investigate diverse questions in the Humanities.\nIn this talk I will address the recently established research group Leiden Humanities AI and NLP group, Leiden HumAN, which works at the intersection of AI and the Humanities. The group focuses on development and application of NLP and deep learning methods in diverse areas of the Humanities, including Linguistics, History, East-Asian studies and Anthropology. The goal is to bring together traditional and state-of-the-art computational methods and foster innovative research in the Humanities. At the same time, the research objective is to increase the role of the Humanities in the development of socially responsible and diverse AI. I will present several ongoing research projects in which members of the group are involved.\nI will also introduce the BA minor Digital Humanities & Atificial Intelligence, an initiative by the Leiden University Centre for Digital Humanities at the Faculty of Humanities. Tailored to appeal to students from all fields of humanities research, the minor aims to complement BA studies with a skill set that includes a foundation in programming, text and image analysis, while offering a space for thinking about and debating digitization, and the influence of AI in our daily lives. The Artificial Intelligence track, starting from the 2023/24 academic year, will offer a deep dive into the theories and advanced methods, including NLP and deep learning, needed to work with and understand the AI revolution.\n\nLocation\nOnline\n\n\nDate & Time\nMonday 12 June 2023, 12:00 - 13:00 (CEST)\n\n\nRegistration\nClick here to register"

Following up on the current “pre-train and fine-tune” paradigm in the field of Computational Linguistics, we will try to reach an understanding of the techniques used in the “fine-tuning” step. Besides this theoretical part, we will have a hands-on session on working with computing clusters. Because carrying out this type of approach requires computational power often not available in personal computers, we will walk through an example of how to script and deploy fine-tuning jobs on ALICE (the high performance computing cluster at Leiden University).

    "text": "New workshop on the latest methods in dialectology\nInterested in dialects? Want to know how to analyse dialects? Want to learn how to create linguistic maps? Then this is the workshop for you! This semester, the Leiden Dialectology Workshop Series will give 5 workshops on different aspects of dialectology; you will learn how to read maps, extract dialect data as well as creating your own linguistic maps with hands on experience.\nDialectology, the study of language variation across geographical space, may not be a subject that is as accessible to everyone as before. At the end of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century, there were numerous dialect surveys conducted around the world, and some of these surveys were published as linguistic atlases (maps) and dialect surveys (tables, lists). These data typically reflect the more old-fashioned speech spoken in rural areas, which were on the verge of extinction when the surveys were conducted due to societal changes. These data, now mostly sitting in the library in book form, are covered in dust and are waiting for more people to utilize them. This workshop series aims to introduce the kind of data present in these linguistic atlases/ dialect surveys, as well as to introduce how to extract these data and analyze them.\nThroughout the semester, we will digitize a dialect dataset together. From this process, we can learn what kind of problems one might face in digitization, as well as learning how to overcome some of them. The digitized dataset will be used in the next semester (Introduction to Dialectometry 2024).\nPlease find the syllabus of the workshop here\n\nInstructor\nMatthew Sung\n\n\nLocation\nLocation: Digital Lab, P.J.

    "title": "Text Alignment Talk with Chris Handy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Cross-linguistic Text Alignment: An Evolutionary Approach\nText alignment is the process of finding similar passages across two or more documents. Text alignment is a process that can be useful in examining multiple versions of a document, whether in one or several languages, or in searching for text re-use within a collection of disparate documents. Some examples of the types of projects that benefit from text alignment include: 1) matching parallel readings of Bible passages across different translations, 2) compiling multiple versions of “Little Red Riding Hood” or other popular narratives, and 3) locating thematically similar texts within a larger corpus (e.g. finding medical literature within a Buddhist canon). Traditionally, the process of text alignment is done by a human being, and the determination of the boundaries of aligned segments is largely intuited from the education and experience of the researcher.\nHowever, if we attempt to automate this process, we quickly find that defining formally what similarity means can be a non-trivial task. This talk focuses on one particular solution to this problem, developed initially for a project in Buddhist Studies but then generalised to cover a wide variety of text alignment problems across any languages and genres. The basic idea is that the data presented to us are always in a less than ideal state, and that alignment of any two passages can never have a single correct solution. Instead of attempting to achieve perfect alignments, my method is to approach a hypothetical ideal alignment through an iterative process that begins with a series of educated guesses about aligned passages and then refines those guesses using a customisable scoring system. I use a simple genetic algorithm, designed in Python, to create a population of “agents” that each possess a sequence of data called a “gene” that dictates the alignment guesses each agent makes about a set of texts. Agents assign scores to themselves based on dictionary matches and other information, and a master controller combines the genes of the top scoring agents to create the next generation of agents. Over multiple generations, these agents evolve toward desired alignments, in a way that is similar to dog breeding or other processes of artificial selection among biological organisms. The system I have designed is free, open source and easy to use, allowing a researcher to select population sizes, mutation rates, scoring mechanisms and other variables to suit any particular alignment project. This software is also made to run on nearly any device, including cluster computers (e.g. the Leiden ALICE cluster), personal computers, mobile phones, and even Raspberry Pi and other single board computers.\n\nLocation\nLocation: PJ Veth 1.16 Time: 12:00-13:00\n\n\nAvailability\nSpots still available"

    "text": "Introduction to Dialectometry (2024)\nMany proposals of dialect classification use isoglosses to identify dialect areas. However, isogloss maps are often messy, and they are also susceptible to some further problems: 1) features shown on a map can potentially be cherry-picked; 2) very often it is difficult to analyse many features all at once, 3) it is difficult to analyse the relationship between dialects (areas) which are geographically distant and 4) it is difficult to assess how representative features are in an analysis.\nIn order to overcome these problems and make dialect classifications more objective, dialectologists have employed computational methods in dialectology, often known as dialectometry , the measurement of dialect distances. Dialectometry applies a set of techniques on a large amount of dialect data in order to get an aggregate picture of the variation hidden the dialect landscape.\nIn this workshop series, the reasoning behind the dialectometric approaches will first be introduced in the first week, then in the following weeks, various techniques in dialectometry will be introduced with hands on exercises. Lastly, the workshop series will end with an overview of the contemporary approaches in the field.\nProgramming knowledge is not required for this workshop series.\n\n\nTime & Location\nTuesdays: 27 February; 12 March; 26 March; 9 April; 23 April at PJ Veth 1.07 DH Lab\n\nAvailability\nRegistration"

    "text": "Most research on dialectometry so far primarily focuses on European languages. Within these studies, analyses on the phonetic level predominantly focus on segments. A lack of studies on languages outside of Europe means that the variation in many lesser-studied languages, including tonal languages, is largely unknown. Tonal languages are languages which pitch is used as an indication in the lexical realisations in (at least some) morphemes, and over half of the world’s languages include lexical tones. Despite tones being the inseparable and unneglectable part of the majority of the world’s languages, there is only a handful of quantitative dialectometric studies on the dialectal variation in tonal languages. In this paper, we explore the phonetic and phonological variations in Yue, a lesser-studied tonal language spoken by around 80 million people in Southern China. Using a newly devised tone representation (modified Onset–Contour–Offset) combined with the Levenshtein distance, we explore the patterns of dialectal variation on the tonal level, as well as to what extent tonal variation correlates with segmental variation. Our results show that tones behave rather differently from segments, and thus, we illustrate that studying lesser-studied and tonal languages can contribute immensely to the study of dialect variation in general.chan\n\n\n\nLocalities and their respective sources"
