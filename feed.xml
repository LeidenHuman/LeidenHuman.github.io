<p>Justin Yeung is joining Leiden HumAN as a staff researcher starting in May 2023. His research interests include political communication, migration studies and science &amp; technology studies (STS). In our group, along with other staff, he will be responsible for two projects, namely Political Social Network in Indonesia and Generative AI for Investigative Journalism.</p>

<p>Text alignment is the process of finding similar passages across two or more documents. Text alignment is a process that can be useful in examining multiple versions of a document, whether in one or several languages, or in searching for text re-use within a collection of disparate documents. Some examples of the types of projects that benefit from text alignment include: 1) matching parallel readings of Bible passages across different translations, 2) compiling multiple versions of “Little Red Riding Hood” or other popular narratives, and 3) locating thematically similar texts within a larger corpus (e.g. finding medical literature within a Buddhist canon). Traditionally, the process of text alignment is done by a human being, and the determination of the boundaries of aligned segments is largely intuited from the education and experience of the researcher.</p>

<p>However, if we attempt to automate this process, we quickly find that defining formally what similarity means can be a non-trivial task. This talk focuses on one particular solution to this problem, developed initially for a project in Buddhist Studies but then generalised to cover a wide variety of text alignment problems across any languages and genres. The basic idea is that the data presented to us are always in a less than ideal state, and that alignment of any two passages can never have a single correct solution. Instead of attempting to achieve perfect alignments, my method is to approach a hypothetical ideal alignment through an iterative process that begins with a series of educated guesses about aligned passages and then refines those guesses using a customisable scoring system. I use a simple genetic algorithm, designed in Python, to create a population of “agents” that each possess a sequence of data called a “gene” that dictates the alignment guesses each agent makes about a set of texts. Agents assign scores to themselves based on dictionary matches and other information, and a master controller combines the genes of the top scoring agents to create the next generation of agents. Over multiple generations, these agents evolve toward desired alignments, in a way that is similar to dog breeding or other processes of artificial selection among biological organisms. The system I have designed is free, open source and easy to use, allowing a researcher to select population sizes, mutation rates, scoring mechanisms and other variables to suit any particular alignment project. This software is also made to run on nearly any device, including cluster computers (e.g. the Leiden ALICE cluster), personal computers, mobile phones, and even Raspberry Pi and other single board computers.</p>

<p>Deep-learning has been used in many recent applications You’ve likely seen use cases such as Stable diffusion, DALL-E image generation, ChatGPT text generation, image classification and, object detection in self-driving cars. Deep-learning is also gaining popularity in the humanities, even beyond NLP uses.</p>

<p>In this workshop we are teaching humanities students &amp; researchers how to train neural networks using PyTorch, thereby allowing them to eventually use this for their own research interests. Meaning this course is heavily focused onto the practical side of neural network programming.</p>

<p>The main focus revolves around visual data, but the basics taught in this course are equally important for language or audio related deep learning:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tensors</strong>: The powerhouse of Deep Learning</li>
  <li><strong>Harnessing</strong> the power of randomness: Training Loops &amp; Lineair regression using Neural Networks (2 March)</li>
  <li><strong>Classification issues and Non-Linearity</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Unleashing the Potential of Images as Data</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Conquering image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Leveraging the power of Transfer Learning</strong>: Harnessing the knowledge of other datasets to reach new heights. With this knowledge, you can continue to teach yourself further in expanding beyond the focus of images onto other forms of data such a text (NLP tasks).</li>
