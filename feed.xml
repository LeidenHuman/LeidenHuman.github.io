<p>Leiden HumAN researchers Wang Ngai Yeung and Leiden Institute for Area Studies researcher Dr. Rizal Shidiq will present at the upcoming event at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) on their latest work Political Social Network in Indonesia (POLISONI).</p>

<h3 id="about-the-event">About the event</h3>

<p>2024 is already promising to be an important year for elections, as over 40% of the world’s population will be eligible to vote. Digital technologies can impact campaigns, political participation, and elections in many ways. In the first event of the OII elections initiative, we would like to zoom in on the digital aspects of the Indonesian election.  We will introduce the background of the Indonesian election and its importance and cover how digital media and technologies are being used by political actors. Additionally, we will discuss online content governance in the context of tensions and power negotiations involved in moderating political content. Relying on social data science approaches, we will present a database on Indonesian candidate profiles developed by researchers at Leiden University. Please join us for a discussion of the different digital aspects of the Indonesian election.</p>

<p>Political social networks in Indonesia is a multidisciplinary project aiming at creating a large-scale digital database of the profiles of aspiring politicians for the upcoming 2024 general elections in Indonesia. On 14 February 2024 Indonesia, home of 205 million registered eligible voters, will hold a massive-scale general election, with about 300,000 candidates running for 20,614 political seats. Political social networks in Indonesia project combines expertise in political economy of Indonesia (LIAS/SSEA) and expertise in web scraping, social network analysis and machine learning (LUCDH/LUCL), in order to make election data freely and easily accessible to all researchers interested in the political economy and democracy in Indonesia.</p>

<p>In this workshop we will present the preliminary results of the project and discuss it with both experts in Indonesian general elections/politics and software developers. The workshop is open to everyone interested in Indonesian 2024 elections and how digital technologies can help us in using web data to create easily accessible research materials for studies on politics and political economy.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we will explore different approaches for applying a Large Language Model (like BERT) to a specific tagging problem in the context of Computational Humanities research. Following up on the current “pre-train and fine-tune” paradigm in the field of Computational Linguistics, we will try to reach an understanding of the techniques used in the “fine-tuning” step. Besides this theoretical part, we will have a hands-on session on working with computing clusters. Because carrying out this type of approach requires computational power often not available in personal computers, we will walk through an example of how to script and deploy fine-tuning jobs on ALICE (the high performance computing cluster at Leiden University). We will complete the workshop emphasising the need for evaluation and comparison of different approaches before consuming the output of the fine-tuned models.</p>

<p>Interested in dialects? Want to know how to analyse dialects? Want to learn how to create linguistic maps? Then this is the workshop for you! This semester, the Leiden Dialectology Workshop Series will give 5 workshops on different aspects of dialectology; you will learn how to read maps, extract dialect data as well as creating your own linguistic maps with hands on experience.</p>

<p>Dialectology, the study of language variation across geographical space, may not be a subject that is as accessible to everyone as before. At the end of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century, there were numerous dialect surveys conducted around the world, and some of these surveys were published as linguistic atlases (maps) and dialect surveys (tables, lists). These data typically reflect the more old-fashioned speech spoken in rural areas, which were on the verge of extinction when the surveys were conducted due to societal changes. These data, now mostly sitting in the library in book form, are covered in dust and are waiting for more people to utilize them. This workshop series aims to introduce the kind of data present in these linguistic atlases/ dialect surveys, as well as to introduce how to extract these data and analyze them.</p>

<p>Throughout the semester, we will digitize a dialect dataset together. From this process, we can learn what kind of problems one might face in digitization, as well as learning how to overcome some of them. The digitized dataset will be used in the next semester (Introduction to Dialectometry 2024).</p>

<p>Deep-learning has been used in many recent applications. You’ve likely seen use cases such as Stable diffusion, DALL-E image generation, ChatGPT text generation, image classification and, object detection in self-driving cars. Deep-learning is also gaining popularity in the humanities beyond NLP uses. Here are the topics we will cover:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tensors</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Single Linear Neuron Models and Training Loop</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Layer Models and Activation Functions</strong></li>
  <li><strong>(Images as Data: CNN and Data Loaders</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation Metrics and Model Performances</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Transfer Learning and Practical Applications&lt;/strong</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Join our 6-part workshop series and go from zero to building a basic image classification model. With this knowledge, you can continue to teach yourself further in expanding beyond the focus of images onto other forms of data such a text (NLP tasks).</p>

<p>Ever since the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the vast majority of research at the intersection of the Humanities and AI was dedicated to the ethical side of AI and how AI impacts our cultures and societies. While philosophy and critical thinking of AI remain indispensable research areas in the Humanities, lately there has been a surge of research that uses AI to investigate diverse questions in the Humanities.</p>

<p>In this talk I will address the recently established research group Leiden Humanities AI and NLP group, Leiden HumAN, which works at the intersection of AI and the Humanities. The group focuses on development and application of NLP and deep learning methods in diverse areas of the Humanities, including Linguistics, History, East-Asian studies and Anthropology. The goal is to bring together traditional and state-of-the-art computational methods and foster innovative research in the Humanities. At the same time, the research objective is to increase the role of the Humanities in the development of socially responsible and diverse AI. I will present several ongoing research projects in which members of the group are involved.</p>

<p>I will also introduce the BA minor Digital Humanities &amp; Atificial Intelligence, an initiative by the Leiden University Centre for Digital Humanities at the Faculty of Humanities. Tailored to appeal to students from all fields of humanities research, the minor aims to complement BA studies with a skill set that includes a foundation in programming, text and image analysis, while offering a space for thinking about and debating digitization, and the influence of AI in our daily lives. The Artificial Intelligence track, starting from the 2023/24 academic year, will offer a deep dive into the theories and advanced methods, including NLP and deep learning, needed to work with and understand the AI revolution.</p>
