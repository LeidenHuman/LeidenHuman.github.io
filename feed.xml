<p>Interested in dialects? Want to know how to analyse dialects? Want to learn how to create linguistic maps? Then this is the workshop for you! This semester, the Leiden Dialectology Workshop Series will give 5 workshops on different aspects of dialectology; you will learn how to read maps, extract dialect data as well as creating your own linguistic maps with hands on experience.</p>

<p>Dialectology, the study of language variation across geographical space, may not be a subject that is as accessible to everyone as before. At the end of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century, there were numerous dialect surveys conducted around the world, and some of these surveys were published as linguistic atlases (maps) and dialect surveys (tables, lists). These data typically reflect the more old-fashioned speech spoken in rural areas, which were on the verge of extinction when the surveys were conducted due to societal changes. These data, now mostly sitting in the library in book form, are covered in dust and are waiting for more people to utilize them. This workshop series aims to introduce the kind of data present in these linguistic atlases/ dialect surveys, as well as to introduce how to extract these data and analyze them.</p>

<p>Throughout the semester, we will digitize a dialect dataset together. From this process, we can learn what kind of problems one might face in digitization, as well as learning how to overcome some of them. The digitized dataset will be used in the next semester (Introduction to Dialectometry 2024).</p>

<p>Deep-learning has been used in many recent applications. You’ve likely seen use cases such as Stable diffusion, DALL-E image generation, ChatGPT text generation, image classification and, object detection in self-driving cars. Deep-learning is also gaining popularity in the humanities beyond NLP uses. Here are the topics we will cover:</p>

  <li><strong>Tensors</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Single Linear Neuron Models and Training Loop</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Layer Models and Activation Functions</strong></li>
  <li><strong>(Images as Data: CNN and Data Loaders</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation Metrics and Model Performances</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Transfer Learning and Practical Applications&lt;/strong</strong></li>

<p>Ever since the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the vast majority of research at the intersection of the Humanities and AI was dedicated to the ethical side of AI and how AI impacts our cultures and societies. While philosophy and critical thinking of AI remain indispensable research areas in the Humanities, lately there has been a surge of research that uses AI to investigate diverse questions in the Humanities.</p>

<p>In this talk I will address the recently established research group Leiden Humanities AI and NLP group, Leiden HumAN, which works at the intersection of AI and the Humanities. The group focuses on development and application of NLP and deep learning methods in diverse areas of the Humanities, including Linguistics, History, East-Asian studies and Anthropology. The goal is to bring together traditional and state-of-the-art computational methods and foster innovative research in the Humanities. At the same time, the research objective is to increase the role of the Humanities in the development of socially responsible and diverse AI. I will present several ongoing research projects in which members of the group are involved.</p>

<p>I will also introduce the BA minor Digital Humanities &amp; Atificial Intelligence, an initiative by the Leiden University Centre for Digital Humanities at the Faculty of Humanities. Tailored to appeal to students from all fields of humanities research, the minor aims to complement BA studies with a skill set that includes a foundation in programming, text and image analysis, while offering a space for thinking about and debating digitization, and the influence of AI in our daily lives. The Artificial Intelligence track, starting from the 2023/24 academic year, will offer a deep dive into the theories and advanced methods, including NLP and deep learning, needed to work with and understand the AI revolution.</p>

<p>Justin Yeung is joining Leiden HumAN as a staff researcher starting in May 2023. His research interests include political communication, migration studies and science &amp; technology studies (STS). In our group, along with other staff, he will be responsible for two projects, namely Political Social Network in Indonesia and Generative AI for Investigative Journalism.</p>

<p>Text alignment is the process of finding similar passages across two or more documents. Text alignment is a process that can be useful in examining multiple versions of a document, whether in one or several languages, or in searching for text re-use within a collection of disparate documents. Some examples of the types of projects that benefit from text alignment include: 1) matching parallel readings of Bible passages across different translations, 2) compiling multiple versions of “Little Red Riding Hood” or other popular narratives, and 3) locating thematically similar texts within a larger corpus (e.g. finding medical literature within a Buddhist canon). Traditionally, the process of text alignment is done by a human being, and the determination of the boundaries of aligned segments is largely intuited from the education and experience of the researcher.</p>

<p>However, if we attempt to automate this process, we quickly find that defining formally what similarity means can be a non-trivial task. This talk focuses on one particular solution to this problem, developed initially for a project in Buddhist Studies but then generalised to cover a wide variety of text alignment problems across any languages and genres. The basic idea is that the data presented to us are always in a less than ideal state, and that alignment of any two passages can never have a single correct solution. Instead of attempting to achieve perfect alignments, my method is to approach a hypothetical ideal alignment through an iterative process that begins with a series of educated guesses about aligned passages and then refines those guesses using a customisable scoring system. I use a simple genetic algorithm, designed in Python, to create a population of “agents” that each possess a sequence of data called a “gene” that dictates the alignment guesses each agent makes about a set of texts. Agents assign scores to themselves based on dictionary matches and other information, and a master controller combines the genes of the top scoring agents to create the next generation of agents. Over multiple generations, these agents evolve toward desired alignments, in a way that is similar to dog breeding or other processes of artificial selection among biological organisms. The system I have designed is free, open source and easy to use, allowing a researcher to select population sizes, mutation rates, scoring mechanisms and other variables to suit any particular alignment project. This software is also made to run on nearly any device, including cluster computers (e.g. the Leiden ALICE cluster), personal computers, mobile phones, and even Raspberry Pi and other single board computers.</p>

<p>In this workshop we are teaching humanities students &amp; researchers how to train neural networks using PyTorch, thereby allowing them to eventually use this for their own research interests. Meaning this course is heavily focused onto the practical side of neural network programming.</p>

<p>The main focus revolves around visual data, but the basics taught in this course are equally important for language or audio related deep learning:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tensors</strong>: The powerhouse of Deep Learning</li>
  <li><strong>Harnessing</strong> the power of randomness: Training Loops &amp; Lineair regression using Neural Networks (2 March)</li>
  <li><strong>Classification issues and Non-Linearity</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Unleashing the Potential of Images as Data</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Conquering image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Leveraging the power of Transfer Learning</strong>: Harnessing the knowledge of other datasets to reach new heights. With this knowledge, you can continue to teach yourself further in expanding beyond the focus of images onto other forms of data such a text (NLP tasks).</li>
