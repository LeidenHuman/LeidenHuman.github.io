# New workshop on the latest methods of dialectology

Interested in dialects? Want to know how to analyse dialects? Want to learn how to create linguistic maps? Then this is the workshop for you! This semester, the Leiden Dialectology Workshop Series will give 5 workshops on different aspects of dialectology; you will learn how to read maps, extract dialect data as well as creating your own linguistic maps with hands on experience.

Dialectology, the study of language variation across geographical space, may not be a subject that is as accessible to everyone as before. At the end of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century, there were numerous dialect surveys conducted around the world, and some of these surveys were published as linguistic atlases (maps) and dialect surveys (tables, lists). These data typically reflect the more old-fashioned speech spoken in rural areas, which were on the verge of extinction when the surveys were conducted due to societal changes. These data, now mostly sitting in the library in book form, are covered in dust and are waiting for more people to utilize them. This workshop series aims to introduce the kind of data present in these linguistic atlases/dialect surveys, as well as to introduce how to extract these data and analyze them with modern, quantitative methods.
