# How to Make a Computer Think like a Human

Deep-learning has been used in many recent applications. Youâ€™ve likely seen use cases such as Stable diffusion, DALL-E image generation, ChatGPT text generation, image classification and, object detection in self-driving cars. Deep-learning is also gaining popularity in the humanities beyond NLP uses. Here are the topics we will cover:

1. <strong>Tensors</strong>
2. <strong>Single Linear Neuron Models and Training Loop</strong>
3. <strong>Multi-Layer Models and Activation Functions</strong>
4. <strong>(Images as Data: CNN and Data Loaders</strong>
5. <strong>Evaluation Metrics and Model Performances</strong>
6. <strong>Transfer Learning and Practical Applications</strong

Please find the syllabus of the workshop [here](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/geesteswetenschappen/lucdh/events/deep_learning_for_beginners_2024-aron_vd_pol.pdf)

Join our 6-part workshop series and go from zero to building a basic image classification model. With this knowledge, you can continue to teach yourself further in expanding beyond the focus of images onto other forms of data such a text (NLP tasks).
